 For proposal #2, note that I mentioned the deserialize call would return an instance of the class. This might not the most ideal thing to do for this method, though.
 
 For proposal #1, I don't think there's actually a problem. You can create an ""empy"" object with a ""dummy"" name and then have the deserialize method overwrite it.

  ... def __init__(self, name):

"One way to make exploitation harder even if there's no guard page would be to add weak secondary stack ASLR in Bionic. The problem with that is it can screw over callers with very precisely sized stacks, as they'll have less available than they expect.

Using a single page for ASLR with stacks >= 1M is arguably sane because they could be screwed over by a compiler update if they're that close to the end...

 If you always throw ShareResourceNotFound (no if/else condition as in your code), manager will do exactly what you are doing, it will swallow the exception and proceed. If it is not ""Deleting path"", as you are checking for such in share status, it will throw exception, just as are you doing, since manager is only swallowing the exception when deleting the share.
 
 The only scenario which I think this is valid is if this library is used outside of Manila, which is what I understood based on our IRC conversation, but by using share['status'] here I am assuming it will not be used outside of Manila Manager code path.

"2 things:
 
 1) Is it possible to UNPAUSE a machine which is RUNNING!? (I would think that you can only UNPAUSE something that is PAUSED, hidden bug? Why UNPAUSING is being saved to the db if the current state is RUNNING?)
 
 2) I think that for [UN]PAUSING we should take a different approach than this.
 
 At this point, the real state of the instance is unknown right? We don't know whether the instance was paused or not, but, we already know the desired state and the current state why we just don't automate that?
 
 If before n-cpu crashed the user requested to pause that instance and I assume that the API have returned saying that the requested was accept, why we don't re-issue the [un]pause_instance() request here?
 
 I mean users would be like: ""fuck yeah automation""!
 
 Instead of just cleaning up the states, leaving the machine in an unknown state and having the user to reissue the request to [un]pause the machine again.
 
 (And sorry if someone already suggested that, I haven't looked in all previous patch-sets to see if that's the case)",1,2 things 1 is it possible to unpause a machine which is running i would think that you can only unpause something that is paused hidden bug why unpausing is being saved to the db if the current state is running 2 i think that for unpausing we should take a different approach than this at this point the real state of the instance is unknown right we do not know whether the instance was paused or not but we already know the desired state and the current state why we just do not automate that if before ncpu crashed the user requested to pause that instance and i assume that the api have returned saying that the requested was accept why we do not reissue the unpauseinstance request here i mean users would be like fuck yeah automation instead of just cleaning up the states leaving the machine in an unknown state and having the user to reissue the request to unpause the machine again and sorry if someone already suggested that i have not looked in all previous patchsets to see if that is the case

 It sounds like you've created a new channel for the decoder to inform the demuxer of a config change. If so, one thing to be aware of (assuming you're still using our decoder stream) is that signalling kConfigChanged from the demuxer will result in a flush of the decoder. Many config changes actually require a different decoder, so this makes sense. But in your case, this is probably wasteful. For videos that change size mid way through, we just signal the new size to the upper layers and avoid the heavy decoder flush.

"Ah, I'd forgotten about the 'disabled by file' part of the middlware!
 
 I guess the difference between a 'graceful shutdown' and using the middleware is that one is event driven where the other one requires you to pick a 'long time' and assume that after that there are no requests being handled.
 
 Which would work ... but the code to implement the graceful shutdown could be pretty easy (potentially just a few lines of code), so might be worth thinking about.
 
 It's probably just a matter of changing these functions in wsgi.py:
 
 
  def wait_on_children(self):
  while self.running:
  try:
  pid, status = os.wait()
  if os.WIFEXITED(status) or os.WIFSIGNALED(status):
  self._remove_children(pid)
  self._verify_and_respawn_children(pid, status)
  except OSError as err:
  if err.errno not in (errno.EINTR, errno.ECHILD):
  raise
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
  LOG.info(_LI('Caught keyboard interrupt. Exiting.'))
  break
  except exception.SIGHUPInterrupt:
  self.reload()
  continue
  eventlet.greenio.shutdown_safe(self.sock)
  self.sock.close()
  LOG.debug('Exited')
 
 
  def run_child(self):
  def child_hup(*args):
  """"""Shuts down child processes, existing requests are handled.""""""
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, signal.SIG_IGN)
  eventlet.wsgi.is_accepting = False
  self.sock.close()
 
  pid = os.fork()
  if pid == 0:
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, child_hup)
  signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIG_DFL)
 
 to look like this:
 
  def wait_on_children(self):
  while self.running:
  try:
  pid, status = os.wait()
  if os.WIFEXITED(status) or os.WIFSIGNALED(status):
  self._remove_children(pid)
  self._verify_and_respawn_children(pid, status)
  except OSError as err:
  if err.errno not in (errno.EINTR, errno.ECHILD):
  raise
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
  LOG.info(_LI('Caught keyboard interrupt. Exiting.'))
  break
  except exception.SIGHUPInterrupt:
  self.reload()
  continue
  except exception.SIGSTOPInterrupt: <<<
  self.graceful_shutdown() <<<
  continue <<<
  eventlet.greenio.shutdown_safe(self.sock)
  self.sock.close()
  LOG.debug('Exited')
 
 
  def run_child(self):
  def child_hup(*args):
  """"""Shuts down child processes, existing requests are handled.""""""
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, signal.SIG_IGN)
  eventlet.wsgi.is_accepting = False
  self.sock.close()
 
  def child_stop(*args): <<<
  """"""Shuts down child processes, existing requests are handled."""""" <<<
  signal.signal(signal.SIGSTOP, signal.SIG_IGN) <<< 
  eventlet.wsgi.is_accepting = False <<< 
  self.sock.close() <<<
 
  pid = os.fork()
  if pid == 0:
  signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, child_hup)
  signal.signal(signal.SIGSTOP, child_stop) <<<
  signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIG_DFL)
 
 
 And add this one line function:
 
  def graceful_shutdown(self):
  """"""
  Send signal to child processes to handle current requests then exit
  """"""
  os.killpg(self.pgid, signal.SIGSTOP)
 
 
 I haven't tested the above, I think it might be sufficient because the existing code will do the accounting of the number of children and exit when self.children hits zero, but it'd need testing.

 * template author(s) write template(s) and annotate them
 * deployer has template that needs capabilities (provided by other templates)
 * deployer discovers other templates that have the capability
 * deployer selects provider templates and writes corresponding env file
 * deployed deploys top level template with the env file

"As noted below, I think you need to assert what you support here.
 
 Right now, if a user does rescue on an instance booted from volume, it looks to me like the following will happen:
 
 * root_vhd_path will return a non-existent path
 * self._vmutils.detach_vm_disk will silently do nothing [1]
 * New disk with invalid path with be added [2]
 
 This definitely won't work as the user intends. As it's unsupported at the moment that's fine, but it would be much nicer to the user to tell them that with a clear error message rather than leaving them wondering why their rescued instance doesn't work.
 
 Also, I haven't looked at the interaction with unrescue, but it's critical that the above mess can be unwound with unrescue. If it currently work it's presumably just luck :)
 
 TL;DR
 
 Not supporting everything is fine, but I think you need to explicitly check that root_vhd_path exists and there is only 1 disk. If not, you need to error out early.

"Well the logic of claiming/consuming instances is not what caused this bug (and it is well tested). What caused it is moving to and from objects in the resource tracker, and then dropping an important field due to that.
 
 So in the resource tracker we have pci pool dicts (would contain numa_node as a key), but then we convert them to objects [1] by using PciDevicePool.from_dict, which would drop the field and save it as part of tags.
 
 Upon reading them in on the scheduler side, we call PciDevicePool.to_dict, which of course will not know about the 'numa_node' since it's not on the object. For filtering to work numa_node needs to match (and it's actually gone) so all requests fail.
 
 The code in [1] merged 2 months after the patch that introduces NUMA awareness of PCI devices.
 
 TL; DR - this got borken by our neverending objects fuckery - it was not broken by definition as you seem to imply with your comments here.
 
 The commit message is misleading though so I will update it now.

"I definitely agree we shouldn't mix the two. I think the list syntax makes more sense in this case than it does in capabilities (I previously made comments to this end on that spec, but they got lost in a previous patchset, so I'll review it again soon).
 
 Take a simple resource registry:
 
 resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::BlockStorage: cinder-storage.yaml
  OS::TripleO::Compute: compute.yaml
 
 What that is saying is that when a template creates a resource of type BlockStorage, it should use the cinder-storage.yaml file.
 
 Taking the example from the capabilities:
 
 requires:
  deployment: puppet
 
 resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::Controller: [puppet/controller.yaml, docker/controller.yaml]
 
 You (as the template reader/maintainer, not as Heat programmatically reading it) are no longer able to see what template will be used. That information has moved to the ""requires"" area plus some additional logic that looks inside the templates themselves.
 
 Now factor in the alternative in this spec for using a parameter driven approach.
 That's now a third place you need to look to understand which template(s) will be used to fulfill a given type, leaving us with the following to understand a set of templates:
 
 1. Look in the resource registry to see the mapping for a type.
 2. If the mapping is a list, look at the requires and the contents of each template referenced to see which one will fulfill the requires.
 3. Look through the top level template itself for any ResourceChain resources, determine the name of the parameter that's used to convey the list of templates in the chain, then resolve what the current value of that parameter is.
 
 IMO, this is a rough experience for the user. We've taken the knowledge of how a stack will be created and spread it over the course of multiple areas and files.
 
 By comparison, my argument is that:
 
 - Capabilities aren't a black box resolution by Heat, but rather just metadata the user can ask Heat to introspect to determine valid mappings to make in the resource_registry. 
 - Chains are communicated inside of the registry itself.
 
 That flow leaves the mappings in a single place: the resource registry.

"> javascript: stupidest thing ever?

So interesting :D It seems you are asking if this can be treated as plain text. But I don't think GURL is smart enough to understand javascript syntax. Telling ""javacript: stupidest thing ever?"" from ""javascript: var a = 0; alert(a); "" would be really difficult. So is_valid() returns true for both I guess. (roughly tested but ""javascript: stu..."" wasn't droppable with is_valid())

> we shouldn't even try to check the Javascript scheme here,

This reminds me of our previous conversation. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1013821/7/chrome/browser/ui/views/frame/browser_root_view.cc#180
Like !file_supported case, I think arrow on tabstrip and cursor icon should indicate that javascript scheme can't be dropped during drag session. So I think it's better to check the scheme here as long as we can.

> I also wonder if this shouldn't merge with omnibox drop handling so we just allow but auto-strip javascript: instead of banning it...

This seems to be worth trying. Let me give it a shot before long.",1,javascript stupidest thing ever so interesting d it seems you are asking if this can be treated as plain text but i do not think gurl is smart enough to understand javascript syntax telling javacript stupidest thing ever from javascript var a 0 alerta would be really difficult so isvalid returns true for both i guess roughly tested but javascript stu was not droppable with isvalid we should not even try to check the javascript scheme here this reminds me of our previous conversation like filesupported case i think arrow on tabstrip and cursor icon should indicate that javascript scheme can not be dropped during drag session so i think it is better to check the scheme here as long as we can i also wonder if this should not merge with omnibox drop handling so we just allow but autostrip javascript instead of banning it this seems to be worth trying let me give it a shot before long

correct -- it /could/ have been if base::Process::Open* fails. on the other hand, if base::Process::Open* succeeds but finds a proc with a different parent (due to pid reuse), we know that we should ignore this process.

> However, its child processes may not be killed yet, so we need to add its pid to the flat_map and continue hunting for the descendant processes. 

ah, i see. that's a good point. but if the pid was reused, we don't want to kill the new proc's kids! to be totally paranoid, OpenProcessIfChildOf would need to report to callers whether the pid was definitively reused or not. i think what you have now is good enough for test code. maybe drop a comment explaining the possibilities since it's a bit subtle.

> Either version works fine for this specific case as killing the direct child process automatically kills all the descendant processes (gpu, utility, etc) per my local tests.

 In the interim: you're right. We can't accept dropping all the tests for a capability at a vendor's request, so I'm -1.

"Yes, I found the issue when the passwd entry was legitimately missing. I was surprised to see both arc-networkd processes running as root in `ps`.
 
 Under normal circumstances the entry shouldn't be missing, and the risk of something affecting *this* daemon is low. But security-critical code often gets attacked in ways that cause something that ""shouldn't"" fail to fail, e.g.
 
 - Maybe the bad guy can't write arbitrary contents into /etc/passwd, but (on a normal Linux box) he might be able to trick a careless cron job into erasing/clobbering its contents through symlink attacks. And then subsequent calls to getpwnam() fail.
 
 - Since Chrome OS uses dm-verity to protect the rootfs contents, somebody can't get the OS to return arbitrary data when reading a file. But maybe they can get the OS to return an I/O error if the file data is overwritten with bad content on disk.
 
 - Exhaustion attacks can sometimes induce failures that are useful to a hacker, e.g.
 
 https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/255-android-rooting
 
 What if somebody opens up 1023 file descriptors, then runs a setuid program that fails to open the 1024th FD and reacts in a careless way?

"> > This previously used a TestNavigationObserver, but this no longer works for the filesystem URL following Mustafa's r554850, because a top-level filesystem URL navigation will be blocked on the renderer side.  I wanted to keep this test uniformly handling both blob and filesystem URLs, so I tried to use WaitForLoadStop(), which just exits immediately if a navigation hasn't started yet.  However, with blob: URLs, that still didn't work, because that navigation is scheduled on the renderer side, so the ExecuteScript that sets location above returns before we've received the BeginNavigation from the renderer.  Hence this ugly extra dummy ExecuteScript.  Without it, we performed the checks below too early, and when GetTextContent() below did a roundtrip to the renderer, we actually received the BeginNavigation and created a speculative RFH, which caused GetRenderFrameHostsForExtension to fail.

No, unfortunately blobs don't output the console error.  Given that, I'll stick with this approach.

then when the ManifestVersionedSyncStage.GetNextManifest runs, it tries to use manifest_version.current_version (which is still None) and we hit this error here when we try to print out None.

there's multiple ways to fix this, but they all kind of suck.  the test is trying to exercise just the stage without getting too much into the manifest_version internals.  so i put the str() here.

it's a non-issue for ForceVersion because it is given a real string rather than pulling out an uninitialized (due to test stubbing) version of None.",1,the issue is with testmanifestversionedsynconepartbranch it stubs out manifestversionbuildspecsmanager which is responsible for initializing manifestversioncurrentversion that means it stays at the object default of none then when the manifestversionedsyncstagegetnextmanifest runs it tries to use manifestversioncurrentversion which is still none and we hit this error here when we try to print out none theres multiple ways to fix this but they all kind of suck the test is trying to exercise just the stage without getting too much into the manifestversion internals so i put the str here it is a nonissue for forceversion because it is given a real string rather than pulling out an uninitialized due to test stubbing version of none

"HmmmÃ¢â‚¬Â¦as far as I can see, you never reset requests.request, which, IMO, is a bad thing. A better way to accomplish what you want is by using mock.patch() in a context manager:
 
  mock_request = mock.Mock()
  mock_request.return_value = requests.Response()
  mock_request.return_value.status_code = 200
  mock_request.return_value.headers = {
  'x-server-management-url': 'blah.com',
  'x-auth-token': 'blah',
  }

  instance.authenticate()
  mock_request.assert_called_once_with(mock.ANY, mock.ANY,
  timeout=2,
  headers=mock.ANY,
  verify=mock.ANY,
  config=mock.ANY)
 
 This will isolate the patch on requests.request to just the call to instance.authenticate(). I will also frequently use the decorator form of mock.patch() in this instance, e.g., something like:
 
  @mock.patch('requests.request', return_value=requests.Response())
  def test_client_with_timeout(self, mock_request):
  Ã¢â‚¬Â¦
  mock_request.return_value.status_code = 200

  Ã¢â‚¬Â¦

Worse, if the init method goes and invokes methods to finish initialization, if an intermediate value is stashed on the instance, the method can use that value w/out you getting an AttributeError; etc, thus assign once stable.

 We might need to worry about sqrt, but I'd need to profile. I'll try comparing performance to versions that stub out sqrt.
 
 It's not much of an issue on my desktop, where the *total* cost to record the 3 latency derived metrics is ~3us. It's >10us on my Pixel 1 though. That includes re-calculating a sqrt from N frames ago to subtract from the WindowedAnalyzer's accumulator. So there's 6 sqrts total per source frame (3 metrics * 2 sqrts).
 
 All the sqrts currently use double precision, but I'm pretty sure single precision would be good enough. In general, after getting the basics in place, I'd like to switch the double precision math over to single precision where we can.
 
 If we really need to, we could use a sqrt approximation. As long as the approximation is monotonic, it should be good at tracking relative performance deltas even if the absolute value might be off a bit.

"If we want to make better use of the existing atomic structure, we need to remove target line interrupt and its ISR. However, we cannot prevent target line interrupt and its ISR, even we support all the functions which have already mentioned by Bibby.
 
 The behavior of CMDQ is more like CPU rather than shadow register. If we use shadow register, we just need to change register set in vblank. But, if we use CMDQ, we still need to make sure CMDQ can process all its tasks in vblank. Although CMDQ is faster than CPU to access register, CMDQ still has its limitation. In other words, we cannot insert too many tasks into CMDQ. If CMDQ cannot process all its tasks in vblank, we will see garbage line on screen.

 The basic idea is that we should not ping DUT too often.

 We wanted to test the capability of DUT to maintain an idle connection with AP (this involves time synchronization, wake up from power-saving mode).
 
 DUT should remain the connection during the test.

as for _POSIX2_FORT_DEV, note the ""if"" in what POSIX actually says: ""If this symbol is defined in <unistd.h>, it shall be defined to be -1, 0, or 200809L."". the little ""[FD]"" next to the name means that this is part of the optional extra FD (Fortran Development). we don't have that, so we don't need to have any of the defines, and it's probably less confusing to just remove them.

"(It took me a month to understand what this code was supposed to do, so who is being stupid here?:).
First, I find out if the destination is 1 cell or a range, and if the source area is large than the selected destination area [1271-1279]. The largest area of these is taken for the comparisons [1282-1283], as this will be the actual destination area (copy/paste some blocks and you will see what I mean if my text is not clear).
The first comparison is whether source and destination area overlap [1284-1288]. When the source area contains references, these probably will go wrong when there is an overlap. As this may produce data loss (e.g. formulas that get wrong references), it _must_ be avoided. This code was there from the beginning, but with errors, disabling the wrong options. My first patch fixed only a part of that.
The second comparison [1294-1327] handles something else, the question whether shifting the cells in the destination area will fit on the sheet. This comparison is not necessary for integrity, but for user friendliness. Without the comparison, the user will get a message that the result will not fit and no harm is done. Rainer Bielefeld wanted the possibilty of fitting on the sheet reflected in the en/disabling of the shift options.
I do this check by going from the MAXCOL/MAXROW position back for the width/height of the destination area and checking if the cells are empty. If not, paste+shift will not fit and the appropiate shit option is disabled.
I feared a performance penalty with this method, but I tested it on an old. slow machine (complete build of Libreofiice takes 24hrs) with a destination area almost MAXROW high and that gave no noticeable delay.
But because of this performance penalty danger, i want you to have a good look at the code. Perhaps it will be safer to leave it out, perhaps there are more efficient ways to check the fitting.

I hope my proze give you the explanation you want.

"This previously used a TestNavigationObserver, but this no longer works for the filesystem URL following Mustafa's r554850, because a top-level filesystem URL navigation will be blocked on the renderer side.  I wanted to keep this test uniformly handling both blob and filesystem URLs, so I tried to use WaitForLoadStop(), which just exits immediately if a navigation hasn't started yet.  However, with blob: URLs, that still didn't work, because that navigation is scheduled on the renderer side, so the ExecuteScript that sets location above returns before we've received the BeginNavigation from the renderer.  Hence this ugly extra dummy ExecuteScript.  Without it, we performed the checks below too early, and when GetTextContent() below did a roundtrip to the renderer, we actually received the BeginNavigation and created a speculative RFH, which caused GetRenderFrameHostsForExtension to fail.

Alternatively, I could wait for filesystem URLs to fail with a console error, similar to what Mustafa did on line 1118.

Separately, in light of Mustafa's change (once we're certain that it sticks), we might want to kill the renderer if it actually sends us a BeginNavigation with a top-level filesystem URL (to handle the compromised renderer case) and add a separate test for that.",0,this previously used a testnavigationobserver but this no longer works for the filesystem url following mustafas r554850 because a toplevel filesystem url navigation will be blocked on the renderer side i wanted to keep this test uniformly handling both blob and filesystem urls so i tried to use waitforloadstop which just exits immediately if a navigation has not started yet however with blob urls that still did not work because that navigation is scheduled on the renderer side so the executescript that sets location above returns before we have received the beginnavigation from the renderer hence this ugly extra dummy executescript without it we performed the checks below too early and when gettextcontent below did a roundtrip to the renderer we actually received the beginnavigation and created a speculative rfh which caused getrenderframehostsforextension to fail alternatively i could wait for filesystem urls to fail with a console error similar to what mustafa did on line 18 separately in light of mustafas change once we are certain that it sticks we might want to kill the renderer if it actually sends us a beginnavigation with a toplevel filesystem url to handle the compromised renderer case and add a separate test for that

"> kill -0 basically validates the pid
That's a smart way to validate a pid.
I will update Makefile with kill in a separate CL.

> There's another case here though where the master could be dead but the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master... maybe check the command line as well or cwd of the pid?  fds etc?

I believe that it should be considered as unhealthy status of twistd.

For example, if ""make status"" returns 0 for a process running, but unhealthy, then puppet or most of system management tool would believe that it is not running, and the following /etc/init.d/buildbot start would fail at the following check

: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build.git/+/master/slave/run_slave.py#249


We could also update the above python check function, but I believe that the example case you provided should be handled by a separate process checking for the health of a service: ""the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master""

In other words, /etc/init.d/status should return ""running"" if a process is running for the service either it is healthy or not.

If ""make status"" should not be limited to the usage of /etc/init.d/buildbot, then I'd suggest to have another make target for health checking.

When doing default arguments/fallbacks like this, one needs to be *extremely* explicit in the check else you can get bit in the ass pretty easily.

Consider the following prototype:

def DoSomeStuff(myargs, cache_override=None):
  if not cache_override:
    cache_override = self._internal_cache
  self._ReallyDoStuff(myargs, cache_override)

It's subtle, but that block of code will incorrectly fallback to the internal cache if the passed in cache_override is {} (which may be entirely intentional- to force a run w/out using internal caches values).

If you use the 'is None', check, it handles it correctly.

 Similarly, if a query is done for `instance` it is unlikely, but not impossible, that some data after the upgrade will come from notifications and some from polling.
 
 Therefore I need the answer to two questions:
 
 * How can I form a query that says ""only give me polling data for meter X""?

 Is there metadata that will allow filters on that?

 If you say that (the same) tag can be associated to multiple resources, and that (the same) resource is associated to multiple tags, this is not the right way to model this logically, otherwise you'll end up having lots of duplicated and a non-normalized schema.
 
 Say for instance that I want to tag my networks with 'golden'. I'd need to have lots of entries like so:
 
  1, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_1
  2, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_2
  3, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_3
  4, golden, 'my golden tag', network, net_4
 
 This is a waste from a number of perspectives: from storage, lookup and cascading effects.
 
 Instead you should have, a tag table
 
  tag, description, where tag is key
 
 and a mapping table
 
  tag_id, resource_type, resource_id
 
 This still sucks though, because now you cannot enforce the foreign key constraint on resource id; i.e. if a resource gets deleted now you gotta enforce the delete on cascade via programming logic, which is yucky.
 
 Ultimately we'd need to have a mapping table for resource. I know, it's more work, but that gives you the most leverage of the DBMS capabilies",1,i am a bit concerned about the implementation here if you say that the same tag can be associated to multiple resources and that the same resource is associated to multiple tags this is not the right way to model this logically otherwise you will end up having lots of duplicated and a nonnormalized schema say for instance that i want to tag my networks with golden id need to have lots of entries like so 1 golden my golden tag network net1 2 golden my golden tag network net2 3 golden my golden tag network net3 4 golden my golden tag network net4 this is a waste from a number of perspectives from storage lookup and cascading effects instead you should have a tag table tag description where tag is key and a mapping table tagid resourcetype resourceid this still sucks though because now you cannot enforce the foreign key constraint on resource id ie if a resource gets deleted now you gotta enforce the delete on cascade via programming logic which is yucky ultimately wed need to have a mapping table for resource i know it is more work but that gives you the most leverage of the dbms capabilies

"My vote would be to have just one generic flag.

GDB-info is misleading since Dwarf can be used by many tools - including LLDB, and libbacktrace.

I like DebugSymbols more.  I would say it sounds like a DwarfSymbols (i.e. .debug_* sections), but not everyone might not know the name Dwarf so it is good generic name.

But both of the above seem to imply that they only control inclusion/exclusion of debug data.  I think it would be conceivable that the flag could have deeper effects.  Say, do not deduplicate methods to make sure they can be identified, or omit some optimizations that rearrange code.

Anyway, this is just bike-shedding about names.  I would not want to change it as part of this CL.  I picked GDBInformation here somewhat randomly, and made sure it is at least consistent with Quick and Elf Writer.

"So GAE sucks. Apps do not have access to their app ID during init() time. I had to resort to this late binding via ""placeholders"" in the pattern strings, e.g.:

func init() {

    // Do validation.
  })
  validation.Rules.Add(""regex:projects/.*"", ""${appid}.cfg"", func(...) error {
    // Do validation.
  })
}

I couldn't find a cleaner solution :(

The worst part about it is that the actual config loading API (cfgclient.Get) doesn't use ${appid}. Users will have to be careful to construct exact same strings as they use in validation patterns.

Do you have any suggestions?

I'm considering moving this placeholders shit up a layer into the root of the config library, so that both cfgclient and validation rules can use it (e.g. we'll be able to do cfgclient.Get(..., ""services/${appid}"", ...)). But it adds a weird-ass concept to already incredibly complicated API.

 I believe that it should be considered as unhealthy status of twistd.
 
 For example, if ""make status"" returns 0 for a process running, but unhealthy, then puppet or most of system management tool would believe that it is not running, and the following /etc/init.d/buildbot start would fail at the following check
 
 : https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build.git/+/master/slave/run_slave.py#249
 
 
 We could also update the above python check function, but I believe that the example case you provided should be handled by a separate process checking for the health of a service: ""the pid is valid and doesn't belong to the master""
 
 In other words, /etc/init.d/status should return ""running"" if a process is running for the service either it is healthy or not.

"there is no hwmod entry for opt clocks.

""Any clocks other than fck/ick need to make use of clock FW APIs if required. For fck/ick do not use clock FW APIs as omap_device layer APIs takes care of the same. There is a opt_clk fld for other clocks (example: GPIO has debounce clock)""

there is a opt_clk field en the hwmod structures but they are not enable when you enable the device:

 I tried a few things but I'll keep it as-is if you don't object.
 
 Conceptually I want a ""Future<Boolean> testLoaderResult"" object for which I can set the boolean value without unblocking the test thread (in requestSeedFromService()), and then unblock it later (in onBackgroundWorkFinished()).
 
 Basing such on object on CallbackHelper might not be any better than what I have now; I can't explicitly protect the derived class' boolean with CallbackHelper's internal lock, so the boolean field would need to be handled just as carefully as MutableBoolean currently is.
 
 Basing the object on FutureTask is confusing because the Runnable/Callable has nothing to do.

"funny definition of ""shorter"". 
Getting the human readable version is done to be consistent with other checks that not only print ""bah, your installed version sucks"", but also being able to print ""we detected that you have version xy installed, but we need at least version wz""

Also your proposal fails short since not all versions of flex report the version as second field. Especially those that are not suitable to build (like 2.5.4 for example) print ""flex version <whatever version>"":
$ /usr/bin/flex -V | cut -d"" "" -f2 | sed 's/\.//'g
version

Also while your suggestion works for something like flex (where not much releases are expected), it doesn't account for increase/decrease of the digits in the minor/micro version part

while 2.5.36 will fulfill the test when shortened to 2536 and compared to 2535, a hypothetical version 2.6.1 will be treated as 261 and thus fail the check.

If you only want one single command, and disregard storing the version for printing in the error in case of failure to pass, then one could use 

flex --version |awk '{split($NF,ver,"".""); printf(""%d%03d%03d"", ver[1], ver[2], ver[3])}'

of to be ""shorter"" :-) : flex -V | awk ....

But That is less readable, and requires doubling of the brackets to satisfy autoconf quoting.",1,funny definition of shorter getting the human readable version is done to be consistent with other checks that not only print bah your installed version sucks but also being able to print we detected that you have version xy installed but we need at least version wz also your proposal fails short since not all versions of flex report the version as second field especially those that are not suitable to build like 254 for example print flex version whatever version usrbinflex v cut d f2 sed sg version also while your suggestion works for something like flex where not much releases are expected it does not account for increasedecrease of the digits in the minormicro version part while 2536 will fulfill the test when shortened to 2536 and compared to 2535 a hypothetical version 261 will be treated as 261 and thus fail the check if you only want one single command and disregard storing the version for printing in the error in case of failure to pass then one could use flex version awk splitnfver printfd03d03d ver1 ver2 ver3 of to be shorter flex v awk but that is less readable and requires doubling of the brackets to satisfy autoconf quoting
